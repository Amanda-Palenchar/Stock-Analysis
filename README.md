# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project was to support a financial advisor on a stock trading analysis. This particular advisor wanted to know which stocks were being trading, at which quantities, and for which percentage of return. This could all be automated in VBA, so that this data was readily available at the click of a button from an Excel file of data.

## Summary
Refactoring code is a valuable use of time for any developer because it saves time for the user and generally improves the users experience. The slightest improvements in efficiency in code can return huge time savings when going through thousands or millions of lines of data. Additionally, the code may be streamlined, so that it is easier to understand and amend. The only potential disadvantage, in my opinion, is that refactoring takes extra time for the developer that could potentially be spent on other projects for an organization.
